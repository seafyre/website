First-use experience is where product promises meet product reality.

A useful pattern is to structure onboarding around one clear user goal and remove all optional steps from the first session. Complexity can be layered later.

- Time to first meaningful action
- Language clarity in forms and empty states
- Confidence signals that show progress

Small reductions in friction during this stage often compound into better retention.
