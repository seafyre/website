Strong case studies focus less on screens and more on decision quality.

The best structure is: context, constraints, process, tradeoffs, and measurable results. This helps potential clients understand how you think.

- Business problem and user problem are both explicit
- Design decisions are tied to evidence
- Results include measurable outcomes where possible

A concise, evidence-based narrative usually outperforms a visual dump.
