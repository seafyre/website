A UX audit is valuable when teams feel conversion or engagement problems but cannot isolate where the issue starts.

Typical triggers include an increase in support tickets, stalled funnel metrics, and repeated stakeholder disagreement about priorities.

## Audit output that helps teams ship

- Prioritized issue list by severity
- Evidence tied to specific screens and states
- A realistic execution sequence for design and engineering

The audit should be actionable, not just descriptive.
