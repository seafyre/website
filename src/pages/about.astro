	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		I am a freelance UX designer helping product teams simplify complex workflows, strengthen
		conversion points, and make decisions through user evidence.
	</p>
	<p>
		My process usually combines UX audits, interaction design, rapid prototyping, and workshop
		facilitation. I enjoy projects where product strategy and interface decisions need to meet in
		the same room.
